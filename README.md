OneeChan
====

OneeChan is a userscript that functions on top of 4chan X and allows you to customize the site with various functions, themes and mascots. Mascots are not obligatory and can be changed or disabled altogether.

Originally developed by [seaweedchan](https://github.com/seaweedchan), this fork adds compatibility with various 4chan X versions and more custom options.

#### Compatibility with 4chan X forks and others:
(Updated 2015-03-03)

- [ccd0](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) /// `Compatible` (Recommended)
- [loadletter](https://github.com/loadletter/4chan-x) /// `Compatible`
- [inline](https://boards.4chan.org/) /// `No`

ccd0's 4chan X is the recommended 4chan X version and the one OneeChan is primarily developed for. If you use another 4chan X version, please make sure you select your fork version under `Compatibility` in OneeChan options. Enabling Quick Reply, Persistent QR and Auto Hide QR in 4chan X is recommended for maximum compatibility.


#### Troubleshooting

- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and OneeChan settings and restarting your browser

- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, OneeChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality

- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan/issues) page

- Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan/wiki) for instructions
